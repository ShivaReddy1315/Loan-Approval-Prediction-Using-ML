# Loan-Approval-Prediction-Using-ML



This project leverages machine learning to predict loan approval outcomes based on various applicant features. Using a dataset of past loan applications, this model analyzes patterns in attributes like applicant income, credit history, loan amount, and property area to determine approval likelihood.

 Features

- Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, categorical encoding, and scaling to prepare data for modeling.
- **Model Training**: Implements several machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests) to evaluate and select the best-performing model.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Assesses model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Deployment**: Ready for integration into loan application systems, enabling real-time predictions.

Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data analysis and visualization)

 Usage

Clone this repository, install the required libraries, and run the main script to train and test the model. Adjust hyperparameters as needed to improve model performance.
